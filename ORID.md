**O**: I learnt about Tasking and Context Map, which impressed me, and their application in designing features by splitting a feature into smaller tasks and designing context maps to better structure our code. 
Through the example of Multiplication Table, I was able to practice designing Context Map and how it closely ties into our development. I also learnt about the importance of standard and detailed
 commit messages and their impact of readability and understandability of our code changes.

**R**: Insightful

**I**: It feels insightful to look at feature designing from a different perspective where I previously usually start development quite early without fully designing or planning out the
use of different functions and their input/output values.

**D**: I'm looking forward to applying tasking and context maps into my daily development to help organize my development tasks and to improve my 
code quality through carefully planning and designing before starting to code. Hopefully, this can improve my code quality through reducing the amount of code smell and
refactoring needed, and through that achieve better efficiency in development.
